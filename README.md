# inserction-sort-in-pascal
An exercise from my university course Data Structure.  That algorithm order archives with integer values ranging 1..100 to 1..50,000,000. Exist 48 archives with this logic. The values are ordered, inverted, completely disordered and "almost disordered" (10% of them are out of his correct position). I do this algorithm with some help of ChatGPT.
